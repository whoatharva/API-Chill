### 3. Add Your Own Data

1. Click **“Add Data Source”**
2. Upload documents (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
3. Choose:
   - Subscription
   - Create and select a **Blob Storage account**
   - Create and configure **AI Search resource**
4. Set:
   - Search type: `Semantic`
   - Chunk size: `1536`
   - Data connection type: `API Key`
5. Save and close

> ✅ Tip: Make sure your documents are clean and well-formatted for best results.

### 4. Test in Playground

- Interact with the model using your uploaded data  
- Validate the results and tweak prompts or documents as needed  

---

### 5. Deploy as Web App

1. Click **Deploy > Deploy as Web App**
2. Fill in:
   - App name
   - Subscription & Resource Group
   - Location
   - Pricing plan
   - ✅ Enable chat history (stores in Cosmos DB)
3. Deploy and wait for the setup to complete

### 6. Configure Web App Authentication (with Google)

1. Go to **Azure Portal → App Services → Your App → Authentication**
2. Click **“Add Identity Provider”**
3. Choose **Google**
4. In a new tab, visit [Google Cloud OAuth Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
5. Create a new **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**
   - **Application type:** Web Application
   - **Name:** Anything (e.g., `My Azure Chatbot`)
   - Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add:
     ```
     https://<your-app-name>.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/google/callback
     ```
     ✅ *Example:* `https://apichill01.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/google/callback`
6. Once created, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
7. Return to **Azure → Authentication → Google**
8. Paste the credentials and **Save**
9. Wait a minute or two for propagation

> ⚠️ The redirect URI must match exactly — no trailing slashes, no spaces, no missing segments.
